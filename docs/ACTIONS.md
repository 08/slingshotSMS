SlingshotSMS is scriptable in a multitude of ways, but there's a really 
easy one to start out with. Through the web interface, users can write 
anonymous - unnamed - functions, which are run every time that a 
message is received. They take one parameter, a message object, which 
exposes a few very useful methods which can be chained. With this code 
and regular expressions in Javascript, complex functionality can be 
written very quickly.
